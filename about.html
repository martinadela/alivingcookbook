    (How can we digest our present circumstances collectively from the confinement of our homes?)
    
   </div>

   <div id="text">
    In his book The Poetics of Space, Gaston Bachelard argues that our homes are poetic spaces that become 
    alive through the way we inhabit them. They are indeed a reflection of ourselves. 
    Our kitchens are living laboratories, and one of the only places in our homes where we can create 
    and experiment. Herbs, vegetables, fruits, and spices bring growth, energy, and transformation into 
    our intimate spaces and invite us to act upon the present. Who knew, the unannounced arrival of a 
    global virus would displace every possible future and force us to live confined inside ourselves. 
    How can our art exist purely as a process? How can our own practice adapt to a socially 
    distanced world?

    Artists' Recipes in Confinement is a project created by artist, writer and cook, Martina Mi√±o 
    P√©rez. This project is developed as part of the Alone-Together Artist Home Residency, organized 
    and funded by Kone Foundation. 
    
    This living kitchen is meant to collect through time, recipes from artists, writers, researchers, creatives, 
    who have found refuge in the process of cooking in this current context and wish to express through food.
    This living archive will be updated regularly and is meant to help us cope with living in the moment and creating spaces for warmth and creativity 
    inside our homes. 
    
    It is also meant to be a reflexive and philosophical tool.
